# Info-Mirror
My take on the Raspberry Pi powered mirror.
Inspired by [MagicMirror2](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) and [Smart-Mirror](https://github.com/HackerHouseYT/Smart-Mirror).

I'm using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/google-news-api), mainly to get the Google News top stories section. 

As for the weather info I'm using the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/). Replaced standard icons from Weather Underground with [these icons](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons).

I'm using the free tier for both API's.
