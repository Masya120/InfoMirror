# Info-Mirror
My take on the Raspberry Pi powered smart mirror, rewritten in Go.
Inspired by [MagicMirror2](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) and [Smart-Mirror](https://github.com/HackerHouseYT/Smart-Mirror)

Weather data and forecast provided by [OpenWeatherMap API](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).

I'm using the free tier for both API's.
