# SmartMirror
My take on the Raspberry Pi powered mirror. Inspired by [MagicMirror] (https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) and [Smart-Mirror] (https://github.com/HackerHouseYT/Smart-Mirror).

This is very much a work in progress. The code needs a lot of cleanup and I will be adding more features soon.
