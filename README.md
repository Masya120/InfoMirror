# InfoMirror
My take on the Raspberry Pi powered mirror.
Inspired by [MagicMirror2](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) and [Smart-Mirror](https://github.com/HackerHouseYT/Smart-Mirror).

I'm using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/google-news-api), mainly to get the Google News top stories section. 

As for the weather info I'm using the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/).

I'm using the free tier for both API's. 

This is very much a work in progress. Code needs a lot of cleanup and I will be adding more functionality soon.
